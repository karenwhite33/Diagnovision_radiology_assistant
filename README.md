![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d77e55b-4e63-499f-bb71-826058f9f5c8)


## ⁉️ **Pain Point**

Delays in diagnoses and appropriate treatments due to a lack of technological implementation and continuous training to streamline the workflow of radiologists and physicians when analyzing medical images such as X-rays.

### **Challenges in radiology workflow**

1️⃣ Image Quality Issues

Artifacts, patient movement, or foreign objects that hinder interpretation.
Low-resolution images, making it difficult to identify crucial details.
Overexposed or underexposed images that obscure or distort anatomical structures.

2️⃣ Workload Overload

High volume of studies to review, leading to fatigue and diagnostic errors.
Limited time per case, potentially compromising analysis quality.
3️⃣ Interpretation Variability

Subjectivity: Different radiologists may interpret the same image differently.
Ambiguous Findings: Lesions or abnormalities that are not clearly benign or malignant, requiring additional tests and time.
4️⃣ Case Complexity

Rare pathologies requiring specialized expertise.
Complex patient anatomy that makes interpretation more challenging.
5️⃣ Technical Limitations

Visualization tools lacking advanced features.
Difficulty accessing prior studies due to non-integrated systems.
6️⃣ Communication Gaps

Incomplete reports and challenges in discussing complex cases with other specialists.
7️⃣ Human Errors

Mistakes due to distraction and cognitive bias (e.g., confirmation bias in diagnosis).
Lower-quality images in patients with a high body mass index (BMI).
8️⃣ Regulations and Documentation

Time-consuming need to document and justify every finding.
Compliance with radiation protection and ethical protocols.
These pain points highlight the need for AI-powered solutions like DiagnoVision to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and support radiologists in their diagnostic workflow.
