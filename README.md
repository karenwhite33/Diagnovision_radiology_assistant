# **DiagnoVision: Multimodal Assistant for Chest X-Ray Analysis & Report Generation**

Pain Point

Delays in diagnoses and appropriate treatments due to a lack of technological implementation and continuous training to streamline the workflow of radiologists and physicians when analyzing medical images such as X-rays.

**Challenges in radiology workflow**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Quality Issues

Artifacts, patient movement, or foreign objects that hinder interpretation.
Low-resolution images, making it difficult to identify crucial details.
Overexposed or underexposed images that obscure or distort anatomical structures.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Workload Overload

High volume of studies to review, leading to fatigue and diagnostic errors.
Limited time per case, potentially compromising analysis quality.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation Variability

Subjectivity: Different radiologists may interpret the same image differently.
Ambiguous Findings: Lesions or abnormalities that are not clearly benign or malignant, requiring additional tests and time.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Case Complexity

Rare pathologies requiring specialized expertise.
Complex patient anatomy that makes interpretation more challenging.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Limitations

Visualization tools lacking advanced features.
Difficulty accessing prior studies due to non-integrated systems.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Communication Gaps

Incomplete reports and challenges in discussing complex cases with other specialists.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Human Errors

Mistakes due to distraction and cognitive bias (e.g., confirmation bias in diagnosis).
Lower-quality images in patients with a high body mass index (BMI).
8Ô∏è‚É£ Regulations and Documentation

Time-consuming need to document and justify every finding.
Compliance with radiation protection and ethical protocols.
These pain points highlight the need for AI-powered solutions like DiagnoVision to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and support radiologists in their diagnostic workflow.
